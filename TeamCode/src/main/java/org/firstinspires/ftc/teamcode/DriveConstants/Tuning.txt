Copy the Drive Constants Template and rename it to match the robot's tools (Ex: DriveConstants_ClawFourBar)
Go here-> https://learnroadrunner.com/drive-constants.html#drive-constants
Follow all steps in that section and the rest that are used for tuning the robot using notes from here
This is vest with two people, one on the computer and one on the robot taking orders from the former.
Try to start this in hornet block, it might take a while the first time.
Use as many decimal places as you can in the calculations
If the number is irrational, just put in the equation for it
Before you start make sure to go to the drive constants file in auton assets and change the class it's extending to the one you just made
Go to bottom of the file for fixes to issues
For the drive constants that you need to calculate, you should be able to copy them over from previous drive constants files
   If not, just calculate them yourself
   Track width is from the middle of the wheels
   We are using Gobilda Yellow Jacket Planetary Gear 5204 435RPM motors for all wheels
We are using THREE WHEEL ODOMETRY and you can also probably copy over values in the first Three Wheel Odometry tab
    lateral distance is measured using the middle of the parallel wheels
    Forward offset is from the middle of the perpendicular wheel to the center of the robot
Don't go past 4 decimal places in Feedforward tuning but make sure you are setting the distance to 60 in
    60 in is almost the entire field, each tile is ~24x24 in, plan accordingly
    Please navigate to the drive constants tab with the correct name
    When tuning on the website, COPY DOWN ANY TUNED DECIMAL PLACES INTO YOUR DRIVE CONSTANTS FILE
        This is for all of our sanity, the website doesn't change the actual drive constants file
Do your best on the straight test tuning
    Go from the center of whichever face of the robot you started with and measure from there
    Just use your knowledge of percents and you should be fine
    Don't use and equation to get exact value, but go to like 6 decimal places if you can
The new track width should be close to the measured one but run it 3 times and take the average to make sure
For turn test just put the robot at the corner of a square or use some tape on the ground and you should be fine
Follower PID tuning should be quick, make sure you are tuning the right value, do 60 inches and you should be fine.
    If it's not going to 60 inches, redo Feedforward tuning and straight test tuning
    Reset the Straight test tuning values and the last two values of Feedforward
    It should be smoothly correcting it's path, don't make it too aggressive
    If it's jittery that's the wrong value
    If it's continuously drifting that's the wrong value
    Don't ask how I know, just tune kP
    You can do the square one for fun but it's not required since not all games have room for it
    Same with spline test, just make sure the path works
Make sure you have saved all the values in your Drive constants file and you're all set!

If it's not going well, go to the localization test opMode and run that.
If the tracking is wonky, it's probably either an odometry pod direction or port issue.
    Go to the standard tracking wheel localizer and mess around with the names and directions.
    Do only one change at a time and then test
    To help, run the localization test TeleOp, flip the robot over, and just roll the wheels to see what's wrong
If the driving is wonky, the motor names, directions, or ports are wrong.
    Go to the SampleMecanumDrive file and check the motor names
    If the names line up, then troubleshoot with the motor direction debugger to find out what motors are wrong
    Then fix this in HARDWARE, software patches only make things more complicated down the line, but let someone know of the changes you made
Otherwise you frucked up in the drive constants so start again from where it went wrong
