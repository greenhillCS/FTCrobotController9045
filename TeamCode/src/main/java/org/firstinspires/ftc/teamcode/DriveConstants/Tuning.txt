Copy the Drive Constants Template and rename it to match the robot's tools (Ex: DriveConstants_ClawFourBar)
Go here-> https://learnroadrunner.com/drive-constants.html#drive-constants
Follow all steps in that section and the rest that are used for tuning the robot using notes from here
This is best with two people, one on the computer and one on the robot taking orders from the former.
Try to start this in hornet block, it might take a while the first time.
Use as many decimal places as you can in the calculations
If the number is irrational, just put in the equation for it
Before you start make sure to go to the drive constants file in auton assets and change the class it's extending to the one you just made
Go to bottom of the file for fixes to issues

For the drive constants that you need to calculate, you should be able to copy them over from previous drive constants files
   If not, just calculate them yourself
   Track width is from the middle of the wheels
   We are using Gobilda Yellow Jacket Planetary Gear 5204 435RPM motors for all wheels

We are using THREE WHEEL ODOMETRY and you can also probably copy over values in the first Three Wheel Odometry tab
    lateral distance is measured using the middle of the parallel wheels
        Use the tuning opmode for it afterwards, and then tune it manually a bit for accuracy
    Forward offset is from the middle of the perpendicular wheel to the center of the robot, you will never get this exact

Don't go past 4 decimal places in Feedforward tuning but make sure you are setting the distance to 90+ in
    90in is almost the entire field, each tile is ~24x24 in, plan accordingly
    Please navigate to the drive constants tab with the correct name
    When tuning on the website, COPY DOWN ANY TUNED DECIMAL PLACES INTO YOUR DRIVE CONSTANTS FILE
        This is for all of our sanity, the website doesn't change the actual drive constants file, except for feedforward

Do straight test tuning as many times as needed, accuracy is key.

Lateral Distance should be as good as possible, it should be close to the measured value, if not then run the opmode again

The new track width should be close to the measured one but run it 3 times and take the average to make sure

For turn test just put the robot at the corner of a square or use some tape on the ground and you should be fine

Follower PID tuning should be quick, make sure you are tuning the right value, do 90 inches and you should be fine.
    If it's not going to 90 inches, redo straight test tuning.
    If it's not reading the distance right, tune x/y multipliers more.
    Reset the Straight test tuning values and the last two values of Feedforward
    It should be smoothly correcting it's path, don't make it too aggressive
    If it's jittery that's the wrong value
    If it's continuously drifting that's the wrong value
    Don't ask how I know, just tune kP, nothing good will come of doing any others
    You can do the square one for fun but it's not required since not all games have room for it
    Same with spline test, just make sure the path works

Make sure you have saved all the values in your Drive constants file and you're all set!


IMPORTANT: If something isn't configured right or you just tuned a multiplier/lateral distance, go to the localization test opMode and run that, the robot should match up to the field fairly well.

If the tracking is wonky, it's probably either an odometry pod direction or port issue.
    Go to the standard tracking wheel localizer and mess around with the names and directions.
    Do only one change at a time and then test
    To help, run the localization test TeleOp, flip the robot over, and just roll the wheels to see what's wrong
If the driving is wonky, the motor names, directions, or ports are wrong.
    Go to the SampleMecanumDrive file and check the motor names
    If the names line up, then troubleshoot with the motor direction debugger to find out what motors are wrong
    Then fix this in HARDWARE, software patches only make things more complicated down the line, but let someone know of the changes you made
Otherwise you frucked up in the drive constants so start again from where it went wrong
